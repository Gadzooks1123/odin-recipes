        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a wonderful classic. Essentially acting as a casserole of noodles, this zesty Italian classic has been a staple in many homes for generations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Often prepared with a mix of tomato sauce, herbs, cheese and meat, there are also many options for those with more restrictive diets. Vegetarian lasagna is a good alternative for those looking to avoid meat while still enjoying dairy. Vegan lasagna, on the other hand, foregoes all animal-based products in favor of a fully plant-based meal.</p>
